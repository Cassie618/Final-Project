    <p>GAME ART AND ANIMATION DEGREE OBJECTIVES
        1. Demonstrate and communicate aesthetic skills and choices based on traditional art theory, current game development 
        practices and next-generation research.
        2. Conceptualize and generate pre-production art assets through pre-visualization and prototypes usable for multiple game 
        platforms.
        3. Demonstrate a cross-section of baseline skills needed to create 2D and 3D art, textures and animation assets utilizing 
        industry-standard software tools. 
        4. Demonstrate the ability to build industry-quality game assets specializing in specific 2D and/or 3D art and/or animations 
        utilizing industry-standard software tools, pipelines and platform guidelines. 
        5. Adapt, export, integrate, and optimize game art and animation assets (including shaders and lighting) into 2D and 3D 
        game projects working within a production pipeline and the confines of a projectâ€™s game engine, tools and other 
        constraints. 
        6. Establish collaboration, mentorship and professional leadership skills by working with other disciplines to deliver highly
